####Description
This mission is not to be confused with Altis Life RPG by Tonic. Honestly, I don't like such RPG missions much. 
Instead, Guerilla West Altis Life is an upcomming dynamic SP/COOP mission. The mission was initially inspired by the scouting missions in the "Adapt" chapter from "The East Wind" campaign.
I intend to increase randomization and also want to extend options including civilian interaction.

The mission is not yet well defined and may change its content in future.
